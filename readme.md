The Microsoft SideWinder Precision Racing Wheel is a wheel and 2-pedal controller which
was introduced to the market in 1999 and is still used by many people. 

Windows 10 has a built-in driver for this wheel, however the two pedals are seperated into 2 different
axis (Y and Z axis), thus rendering this wheel incompatible with many games.

This little python script solves this problem by casting the wheel and pedal position into
a virtual XBox360 gamepad and combining the two axis into one Y axis.

The 8 wheel buttons are mapped into some of the XBox360 controller buttons and this mapping can 
be modified by editing the script.

I hope this script will help you enjoy this wheel once again :)
Feel free to use, modify and share this script.
